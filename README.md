# 🎤 AI-Powered Voice Generator

*A smart and efficient Text-to-Speech application with voice modification and enhancement.*

## 🚀 About the Project
This **AI-Powered Voice Generator** is a Python-based application that converts text into speech with natural, clear voices. The app allows users to generate and modify voices using **offline** (pyttsx3) and **online** (Google TTS) engines. Additionally, users can change the voice pitch (male/female) and download the generated audio.

## ✨ Features
✅ Convert text into speech using **pyttsx3** (offline) or **Google TTS** (online).  
✅ Modify voice pitch (Male/Female).  
✅ Normalize and enhance audio for clarity.  
✅ Download generated voice files.  
✅ Simple and interactive **Streamlit** user interface.  
✅ No need for external API keys (offline mode).
